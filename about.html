                    <h1> <span class="text-primary"> </span> About Hotel Cortez</h1>
                <p> Hotel Cortez is a budget hotel located at 620 S. Main Street, opened on August 23 of 1926. 
                    The hotel was renamed Stay On Main as an effort to distance the establishment from its dark past but has been renamed to Cortez again.
                     The 19-floor hotel has 700 guest rooms. The hotel has a checkered history, with many suicides and deaths occurring there
                     But the good news is the hotel is currently functional again.</p>
                     <p>
                        James Patrick March, The original owner of the hotel Cortez, was born on October 30th, 1895 in the Eastern United States.
                          In 1925, he built the Hotel Cortez, 
                         which opened on August 23 of 1926. Having constructed a number of secret rooms and hidden hallways to carry out his twisted hobby of murder,
                          James used the hotel's infrastructure to hide all evidence of his life as a serial killer, 
                          creating blocked hallways and bricked rooms to make killing more fun and keep his victims' bodies for further acts of depravity,
                         as well as concealing their bodies from the police.

                        When you are what I am, you donâ€™t feel things the way normal humans do.
                         An emotion is like a flavor in my mouth. I can taste it. Joy tastes like strawberries.
                          Hate is like ice chips in a martini. .
                         This hotel tastes like strawberries.
